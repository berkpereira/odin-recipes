    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for Lasagna, a dish that is very characteristic to Italy's culture. Happy cooking!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Peeled tomato</li>
        <li>Minced meat</li>
        <li>Lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
